## Installation
This project requires Node.js, Inquirer, and Jest. The user will need to install the npm packages by running ```npm i``` in terminal. 

## Usage
Once the user has installed the necessary dependencies, the index.js file can be run in terminal using Node. This provides the user with prompts for each employee type, or the user can exit the application by selecting "I'm done with the team". The user's answers are used to generate an HTML file that serves as the team profile.
